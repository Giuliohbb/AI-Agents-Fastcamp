Immediate medical attention is required to assess and manage the potential cardiac emergency to ensure the best possible outcome for the patient.\n\nThis classification is crucial to prioritize the most critical cases and provide timely and appropriate care to the patient, considering the severity and potential life-threatening nature of the symptoms presented."
